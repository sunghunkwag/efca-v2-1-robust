# EFCA-v2.1 Default Configuration

# --- Model Dimensions ---
# These are placeholders and should be set based on the specific environment.
state_dim: 4                # State dimension for the environment (e.g., CartPole)
action_dim: 2               # Action dimension for the environment (e.g., CartPole)
lnn_hidden_dim: 256         # Hidden dimension of the CT-LNN dynamics module
probe_dim: 64               # Output dimension of the metacognitive probe network
meta_action_dim: 3          # Number of internal parameters the meta-controller can modulate (e.g., lr, epsilon, lambda)

# --- Training Parameters ---
warmup_episodes: 100        # Number of episodes for Phase 0 (training perception & policy only)
total_episodes: 1000        # Total number of episodes for the main training loop (Phase 1+)
learning_rate: 0.0003       # Learning rate for the task policy and perception module optimizers
meta_learning_rate: 0.00001 # Learning rate for the meta-controller optimizer
gamma: 0.99                 # Discount factor for rewards

# --- EFCA-Specific Parameters ---
meta_interval: 10           # The meta-controller is activated every N steps in an episode
survival_threshold: 50.0    # The moving average of external rewards must be above this to enable intrinsic rewards
clamp_delta: 0.05           # The maximum relative change (e.g., 5%) the meta-controller can apply

# --- Hardware ---
# Can be 'cuda', 'cpu', or 'mps' for Apple Silicon
device: 'cpu'
